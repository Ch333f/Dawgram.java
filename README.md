# Dawgram
Dawgram also known as Nonogram, Hanjie, Paint by Numbers, Picross, Griddlers and Pic-a-Pix and by various other names are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden pixel art-like picture. You must color in/fill in the grid according to the patterns of contiguous full cells given in the rows and columns. Full cells are shown as '@', unknown cells as 'Blank Cell' and cells you are sure are empty as 'X'. If a row or column is invalid (doesn't match the pattern) this will be marked with a 'Red Color', a solved row or column is marked with a 'Green Color', but it may still be wrong because of the other columns or rows.
